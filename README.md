# Door-Lock-Notification-Sensors
Intruder alarms are popular devices used in high security areas. Our electronic device is also designed to alert the user to an intrusion. There are different kinds of intruder detection alarms  , some detect movements by using a laser , some use pressure variations etc but our project consists of a sensor and a control unit as main parts which are connected to each other.Our device could be installed at various locations in houses or offices specially near doors ,windows and almirahs. In our project, we have made a home security system where we will be able to get the notification on our phone every time the door is opened. Here we are using NodeMCU and a Sensor.(The sensor which we are using is a magnetic door sensor and is readily available in electric shops. It is basically a reel switch that gets ON when subjected to a magnet nearby). It on detecting the breakage of the circuit sends message to NodeMCU which further communicates with the application named as IFTTT which sends notifications direct on our mobile phones.
